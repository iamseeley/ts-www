I write my page content in Markdown files and the files get converted to html!\n\nOver the past few years I've built multiple portfolio websites, mostly in React and with a framework like Next.js. I decided to go frameworkless for my personal site and build out the features I needed myself. \n\nSo, this site is a work in progress and always will be. I'm having fun with it.\n\n",
