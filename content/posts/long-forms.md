I've been working on a client project that has a very long web form and I can't figure out a great way to style it. I'm writing this to compile some information on better web form design. So, here's my web form checklist for accessible, visually appealing web forms.

### Web Form Checklist

#### Planning & Design

<div class="flex">
<input type="checkbox" /> Define the purpose of your form
<input type="checkbox" /> Identify the essential fields
<input type="checkbox" /> Organize the fields logically 
</div>

#### UX

<div class="flex">
<input type="checkbox" /> Chunk information 

*if your form is too long it might be helpful to cut it into sections or steps, however nesting labels and inputs too deeply can worsen the UX*
<input type="checkbox" /> Simplify labels
<input type="checkbox" /> Implement conditional fields based on previous inputs
<input type="checkbox" /> Choose optimal field types
<input type="checkbox" /> Enable autofill
<input type="checkbox" /> Provide user feedback and proper form validation

</div>

#### Accessibility

<div class="flex">
<input type="checkbox" /> Ensure keyboard navigability
<input type="checkbox" /> Use semantic HTML
<input type="checkbox" /> Make sure lables and instructions are clear
<input type="checkbox" /> What is the purpose of your form? 
</div>

#### Maintenance

<div class="flex">
<input type="checkbox" /> What is the purpose of your form?
<input type="checkbox" /> What is the purpose of your form? 
<input type="checkbox" /> What is the purpose of your form?
