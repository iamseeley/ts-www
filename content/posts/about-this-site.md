                <p><strong>About this site</strong></p>
                <p>This site is made from a <a href="https://github.com/iamseeley/go-forth">static site generator</a> I wrote in Go. I write my page content in Markdown files and the files get converted to html!</p> <p> Over the past few years I've built multiple portfolio websites, mostly in React and with a framework like Next.js. I decided to go frameworkless for my personal site and build out the features I needed myself.</p> <p>So, this site is a work in progress and always will be. I'm having fun with it.</p>
