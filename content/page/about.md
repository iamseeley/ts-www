## About

Hi there, my name is Thomas and I make things for the web. I mostly find myself developing websites, and experimenting with web technologies.

Nowadays, I'm primarily coding in TypeScript, but I enjoy switching it up and building things with Go and Python.

I am currently looking for full-time roles as a front-end or full-stack developer. Please reach out via email [hello@tseeley.com](mailto:hello@tseeley.com) if you would like to talk!

### Now

I recently started a part-time MS CS program to further improve my programming skills and go deeper on some computer science topics I'm interested in.
