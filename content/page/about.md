## About

Hi there, my name is Thomas and I make things for the web. I mostly find myself designing/developing websites, and experimenting with web technologies.

I use frameworks and libraries like React, Next.js and Tailwind CSS to create interactive, responsive web apps.

Nowadays, I'm primarily coding in TypeScript, but I enjoy switching it up and building things with Go and Python.

I am currently looking for full-time roles as a front-end or full-stack developer. Please reach out via email hello@tseeley.com if you would like to talk!

### Future

In January 2024, I will be starting a part-time Master of Science in Computer Science program to further improve my programming skills and go deeper on some computer science topics I'm interested in. 

### Story Time

During my junior year of college, as a Business Management/Entrepreneurship major, I became very interested in software and web development. Many of the new venture ideas we came up with in class were software services.

None of us knew how to code, so we didn't have a way to test our ideas. I was tired of creating business model after business model, I wanted to build actual products. I started to self-teach myself web development with the goal of building some of our ideas.

My junior year summer, I developed the front end for an online therapy platform that me and a few peers created. It was a part of an Entrepreneurship program in Europe, and at the end we pitched our product to investors!

I fell deep down the web development rabbit hole, and that is where I've been living ever since.

Since that summer, I have completed multiple online software and web development courses. I also started providing web development services to small businesses.
