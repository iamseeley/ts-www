            <h2>About</h2>

<p>Hi there, my name is Thomas and I make things for the web. I mostly find myself designing/developing websites, and experimenting with web technologies.</p>

<p>I use frameworks and libraries like React, Next.js and Tailwind CSS to create interactive, responsive web apps.</p>

<p>Nowadays, I&rsquo;m primarily coding in TypeScript, but I enjoy switching it up and building things with Go and Python.</p>

<p>I am currently looking for full-time roles as a front-end or full-stack developer. Please reach out via email hello@tseeley.com if you would like to talk!</p>

<h3>Future</h3>

<p>In January 2024, I will be starting a part-time Master of Science in Computer Science program to further improve my programming skills and go deeper on some computer science topics I&rsquo;m interested in.</p>

<h3>Story Time</h3>

<p>During my junior year of college, as a Business Management/Entrepreneurship major, I became very interested in software and web development. Many of the new venture ideas we came up with in class were software services.</p>

<p>None of us knew how to code, so we didn&rsquo;t have a way to test our ideas. I was tired of creating business model after business model, I wanted to build actual products. I started to self-teach myself web development with the goal of building some of our ideas.</p>

<p>My junior year summer, I developed the front end for an online therapy platform that me and a few peers created. It was a part of an Entrepreneurship program in Europe, and at the end we pitched our product to investors!</p>

<p>I fell deep down the web development rabbit hole, and that is where I&rsquo;ve been living ever since.</p>

<p>Since that summer, I have completed multiple online software and web development courses. I also started providing web development services to small businesses.</p>
